This repository contains the interactive slides for the seminar **"From LLMs to Agents: Models, Prompts, and Automation"**, presented on **December 23, 2025**, at the **ICAB Incubator** in Brussels.

The presentation provides a technical yet accessible journey from the internal mechanics of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the cutting-edge world of autonomous AI Agents.

## 🎙️ About the Seminar

As AI evolves from simple chat interfaces to autonomous workers, understanding the underlying technology is crucial for developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs. This session cuts through the hype to discuss what these models actually are, why they fail, and how to build systems that *act* rather than just *talk*.

### 👨‍🏫 Presenters
*   **Gian Marco Paldino** – PhD Student @ MLG ULB (Machine Learning Group), focusing on Time Series, Digital Twins, and Causality.

## 🗺️ Presentation Roadmap

1.  **The Mechanics of LLMs:** Probabilistic engines, tokenization, and the Transformer revolution.
2.  **The "Dumb" Side of AI:** Understanding hallucinations, the "Strawberry" problem, and why LLMs fail at basic logic.
3.  **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Moving from "closed-book" memory to "open-book" factual grounding.
4.  **The Model Landscape:** A deep dive into the LM Arena (GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Llama, and DeepSeek).
5.  **Prompt Engineering:** From "Magic Incantations" to Intentional Design and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
6.  **Offline AI:** Privacy and local execution using Ollama (Gemma 3, Qwen 2.5).
7.  **Practical Automation:** Generating code, CSVs, Flowcharts (Mermaid), 3D models (OpenSCAD), and Music (ABC notation).
8.  **The Rise of Agents:** Giving the "Brain" a pair of "Hands" via tool-use loops and Multi-Agent Orchestration (CrewAI, LangGraph).

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/):** The HTML presentation framework.
*   **Highlight.js:** For syntax highlighting of code examples.
*   **Mermaid.js:** For logic and flow diagrams.
*   **LLM Assistance:** The initial structure and HTML/CSS styling were co-authored with AI.
